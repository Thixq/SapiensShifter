/// Core Module Library
///
/// This library provides essential interfaces and models for building
/// modular and scalable applications. It includes abstractions for
/// authentication, local caching, network store operations, and
/// standardized data models.
///
/// Developers can use this library to implement key functionalities
/// while maintaining flexibility and adhering to clean architecture principles.
///
/// Exported Components:
/// - Interfaces for authentication, caching, and network operations.
/// - Models for credentials and base model serialization.
/// - Utility classes for query filtering and ordering.
